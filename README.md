# LeetCode
---
My solutions to LeetCode problems.

My efforts towards working on LeetCode problems is not about preparing for interviews. Rather it is more about keeping my skills sharp (hopefully?).

## C++ Support
I used CLion as my IDE. It is setup up use [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for unit testing.
