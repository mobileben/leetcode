# LeetCode
---
My solutions to LeetCode problems.

My efforts towards working on LeetCode problems is not about preparing for interviews. Rather it is more about keeping my skills sharp (hopefully?).

## C++ Support
I used CLion as my IDE. It is setup to use [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for unit testing. As CLion uses `cmake` for its project structure, one doesn't need CLion to build.

## Python Support
I used PyCharm as my IDE. It is setup to use [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) for unit testing. I used these [instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/testing-your-first-python-application.html) for setting up my Project. Note that my approach is I have a singular project with multiple directories for each problem. I add a Configuration per problem. I will iterate on this over time.
